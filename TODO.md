# TODO
- The category path of a post is displayed above and below the title. Below, each part p links to /categories/p.
  Above, however, each part just leads to the path truncated to that part. I need a way to redirect these automatically.
  For example: /posts/papers should redirect to /categories/papers or (if you want to keep hierarchy) /categories/posts/papers.
- Add BibTeX citation to the footer of a post.

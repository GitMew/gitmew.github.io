# Based on the 'page' layout, except the title is generated from the URL rather than taken from frontmatter.
# This way, you can move around pages whose title depends on their location without needing to change the titles.
# The include of 'message' still allows a description of the page.

<!-- To build the title, split the relative URL (which starts with a /), drop the empty first part, 
     reverse the part order, capitalize each part, and join them. What sucks is that there is no
     elementwise operator in Liquid (at least not that I can see), so 
        page.url | split: "/" | shift | capitalize | join: " ⊂ "
     sadly doesn't work and you need to use a for loop. -->

{% assign categories = page.url | split: "/" | shift %}
{% for cat in categories reversed %}
    {% assign Cat = cat | capitalize %}
    {% assign title = title | append: cat %}
